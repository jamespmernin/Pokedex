# Pokedex

This is a project I began to create a working Pokedex using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

The tutorial I used for creating the initial version is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-VQUKeSU1w

I plan on expanding the functionality as I progress, and I will make note of the updates here.

v1.0:
  Included information for all 898 Pokemon, not just the original 150 from the first generation of games
